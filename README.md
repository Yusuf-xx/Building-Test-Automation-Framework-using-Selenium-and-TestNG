# Building-Test-Automation-Framework-using-Selenium-and-TestNG

Selenium is one of the most widely used functional UI automation testing tools and TestNG is a brilliant testing framework. Test automation frameworks are a set of guidelines or rules to writing test cases. They can reduce maintenance costs and testing efforts and will provide a higher return on investment (ROI) for teams looking to optimize their processes. Testing guidelines include coding standards, test-data management, defining object repositories, reporting guidelines, and logging strategies. Through hands-on, practical experience, you will go through concepts writing reusable and structure code which is easy to maintain and understand, creating helper classes or utilities, write effective test cases, and generating reports and logs.

# Project Structure
The hands-on project on Building Test Automation Framework using Selenium and TestNG is divided into the following tasks:

    Task 1: Understanding Test Automation Framework and creating a directory structure
    Task 2: Creating an automation layer and writing a generic method to invoke a browser and navigate to a URL
    Task 3: Writing wrapper methods to perform user actions
    Task 4: Creating an application layer - using POM or Page Factory as a design pattern
    Task 5: Adding logic to the application layer
    Task 6: Writing test cases in the test layer
    Task 7: Executing test cases via TestNG XML file
    Task 8: Reading configuration from config.properties
    Task 9: Generating logs and reports using Extent report
    Task 10: Adding screenshots to failed test cases
    Task 11: Adding screenshots to the reports
